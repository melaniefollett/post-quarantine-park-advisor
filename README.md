# Project Description
Quarantine blues got you feeling cooped up? Going loony in lockdown? Plan your next trip after all the COVID-craziness ends with our handy-dandy Post-Quarantine Park Advisor! National parks are a wonderous and inspiring feature of the United States. Have you ever been curious about the national parks near you? Where are they located? What animals might you see there? Do they have campgrounds, trails, amenities? Well worry no more, our website is here to help! Use our interactive map to find a park and see its location, entrance fees, and hours of operation. Then explore our informative bar charts to determine the number campgrounds, trails, and events you can enjoy at each park. Interested in getting out and experiencing nature up close? Search our extensive table about the wildlife you could encounter during your trip. Then head over to our cluster map to get more information about the hiking trails available such as difficulty and popularity. Once you’ve chosen a specific park, head on over to our Summary page to get all the information you could ever want about the park’s amenities, events, weather, and contact information. So don’t let the lockdown get YOU down! Once this is all over, use our Post-Quarantine Park Advisor to plan your next outdoor adventure!

# Project Outline
Visualization #1: Map of US with markers for each park location. Popup showing park name, entrance fees, and hours of operation. Visualization #2: Bar chart showing number of trails/campground/events on a dynamic y-axis for the parks (static x-axis). Visualization #3: Cluster map showing trail locations, difficulty, and popularity. Visualization #4: Interactive table of wildlife data that allows the user to search by park or species and sort by species occurrence, abundance, and status. Extras (if time allows): Summary page with dropdown of park names. When a specific park is selected the page display summary info about the park’s available amenities, next upcoming event, overall weather, and contact information.
